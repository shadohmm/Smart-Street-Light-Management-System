# Smart-Street-Light-Management-System
The project is associated with vehicle identification using RFID(Radio Frequency Identification) technology. Our project mainly focuses on the identification of the vehicles on Streets and turning on the street lights whenever a vehicle is identified. We made this project as an extension for the utilization of Fastag which is used by the Government of India to collect the toll tax. This project can save a lot of energy as the energy is consumed whenever required. The Traditional Street Light Management turns the lights on for 12 hours completely, where a lot of energy is consumed. Our project tries to reduce this power consumption. Our project is completely based on the RFID(Radio Frequency Identification) in which Radio Waves are used for the identification of individual vehicles.
